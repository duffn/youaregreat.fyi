# Contributing to You Are Great

Thank you for wanting to contribute. There isn't much to say here as the project is very simple, but there are a few guidelines.

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/duffn/youaregreat.fyi/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- I would certainly be interested in more [greetings and compliments](https://github.com/duffn/youaregreat.fyi/blob/master/api/index.go). They should lean more serious. I may change my mind on that.
- If you have an idea for making this better, please open an issue for discussion.

That's really all. Thanks again.
